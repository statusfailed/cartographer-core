-- | Sequentially compose two hypergraphs, even when types don\'t match.
-- Wires left dangling as a result of mismatched types will automatically be
-- connected to their corresponding boundary.
--
-- in a → b, if a has more outputs, then b will connect to the *lowermost*
-- outputs of a. If b has more inputs than a has outputs, then a will connect
-- to the *uppermost* inputs of b, e.g.:
--
-- This is "asymmetric" because it means no changes ever have to be made to the
-- "a" graph, which is assumed to be much larger than the "b" graph.

--   A has fewer outputs       B has fewer inputs

-- see wiki/ALGEBRAIC.md for implementation details
--
-- NOTE: this is just a special case of rewriting, where the match is every
-- wire connected to the RHS boundary, plus a little extra work to make it
-- "affine".
-- It might be better to reimplement this, but I think handling as a special
-- case makes it a bit faster?
